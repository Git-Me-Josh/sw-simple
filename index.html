          <p>I ask for your support in repealing the ban on recreational marijuana sales in
            Sherwood. Now is the time for Sherwood to look to the future and utilize this
            opportunity to bring much needed revenue to Sherwood.<br><br>
            As one of your City Councilors, I am very aware of the difficulties facing our budget each year. With the cost of PERS ever-increasing and additional demands being placed on our budget, it is imperative we explore all streams of revenue on behalf of our citizens. Permitting the strictly-regulated sale of recreational marijuana in Sherwood enables us to receive our share of the 17% state tax and qualify for an additional 3% city sales tax. These tax revenues will be designated for public safety measures, and will help Sherwood rather than our neighboring cities that permit recreational marijuana sales. <br><br>
            Sales would be limited to those over the age of 21 years old, with strict guidelines in place to ensure absolute and unwavering compliance. The permissible business locations would be restricted to our Industrial zones, far away from schools, retail and shopping areas, parks, churches, and residential neighborhoods. <br><br>
            While a very slim majority of Sherwood voters did vote against legal sales
            previously, I believe that many have changed their minds since then. We have seen
            the statewide tax revenues absolutely dwarf the projected estimates, and legal sales continue to rise across the state. Unless we vote to repeal the ban, Sherwood will receive no tax revenues. <br><br>
            I believe that Sherwood would benefit greatly from any tax revenues, and that the
            fear of legal sales has been overblown by opponents and those with outdated "reefer madness" notions of marijuana. <br><br>
            Please join me in supporting this ballot measure – vote YES on Measure 34-299!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Abdullah Naimi, Sherwood Resident & Supporter</h4>
          <p>I’m a proud Sherwood resident and love living in this community. I’m a Sherwood
            voter and a businessman who values the safety and security of my community above
            all else. The November 2016 vote narrowly rejected the introduction of recreational marijuana businesses in Sherwood. The Sherwood of Tomorrow Committee studied the past election results and have worked with a cross-section of Sherwood citizens, as well as expended significant amounts of time and resources, to better understand what should be done to improve Sherwood’s approach to recreational marijuana
            businesses. The community spoke and Measure 34-299 incorporates every concern
            shared by citizens. For example, some Sherwood citizens expressed concern that the
            2016 ballot measure permitted a wide range of zoning locations for marijuana
            businesses, so this petition was written to expressly limit businesses to the
            industrial zones located on the Tualatin-Sherwood road between Sherwood and
            Tualatin.<br><br>
            The operation of secure and state-approved recreational marijuana businesses only
            in Sherwood’s strictly defined industrial zones will ensure that safety and security remain the paramount focus of any recreational marijuana business of any kind.<br><br>
            I ask for my fellow citizens’ support this November so that we can help bring
            
            additional revenue to our community and guarantee a permanent, safe and locally-
            controlled management of recreational marijuana businesses in Sherwood. Vote YES
            
            on Measure 34-299!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Aimee Mayfair, Sherwood Businesswoman</h4>
          <p>My name is Aimee Mayfair and I want to express my reasoning for my support of
            Measure 34-299 and invite you to join me to help overturn the ban on recreational
            marijuana businesses in our city. <br><br>
            First, the operation of secure and state-approved recreational marijuana businesses only in very strictly defined areas in Sherwood’s industrial zones will ensure that safety and security remain the paramount focus of any recreational marijuana business of any kind.<br><br>
            Second, Sherwood has not prevented the widespread use of marijuana products in
            town, but instead the ban has encouraged black market sales and has completely cut
            off the city’s access to its much needed tax revenues! After rejecting recreational
            marijuana November 2016, the City of Sherwood became ineligible to receive any
            portion of the taxes on the sales of recreational marijuana items. Fast forward to the end of 2016 and more than $60.2 million was collected, a full 6 times the amount
            estimated! Every year Sherwood loses out on hundreds of thousands of dollars to
            benefit our community, and it’s time for our city to claim the funds we need! <br><br>
            By supporting this measure, you will enable Sherwood to collect its fair share of
            Oregon’s statewide tax marijuana sales revenues and 100% of the locally-applied
            tax on sales for public safety expenditures.
            Please join me this November 7 and Vote YES on Measure 34-299!</p>

        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Anthony Stuart, Sherwood of Tomorrow Committee</h4>
          <p>I have the privilege of serving the Sherwood citizens and businesses behind the
            Sherwood of Tomorrow Committee and Measure 34-299. I wanted to share how this
            measure further limits adult-use cannabis regulations initially proposed by
            Sherwood’s City Council when it was preparing to regulate recreational marijuana.<br><br>
            While the Sherwood City Council originally permitted a wide range of zones for
            marijuana businesses, this measure is written to only allow licensed businesses in
            the industrial corridor between Sherwood and Tualatin on the Tualatin-Sherwood
            Road. Adult-use cannabis businesses will not be visible to families or children
            enjoying Old Town, their days out shopping in the city’s retail centers, or anywhere
            near schools, parks or residential areas.<br><br>
            Every single new business that aims to operate in Sherwood will remain subject to a
            Type II application process that involves notice to neighbors and the city, with
            required city approval. All businesses will also be required to complete a Site Design
            Review, managed by the city, to ensure that the city will have facilities that comply
            with the city’s current design standards. This includes ongoing landscaping and
            aesthetic requirements to ensure the city remains beautiful and visually coherent.<br><br>
            No mobile, temporary or drive-through facilities will ever be allowed to operate, and
            each marijuana retailer will be limited to 3,000 square feet or less. All businesses
            will be subject to strict OLCC-regulated security requirements, including 24-hour
            monitoring, off-site backup, and regular compliance verifications. Every marijuana
            product sold in Sherwood will be subject to the strictest pesticide and safety
            regulations in the country, so if you choose to partake, you’ll never have to wonder
            whether your product is safe.<br><br>
            Your support in voting YES on Measure 34-299 will ensure that the black market is
            run out of Sherwood and business can grow responsibly in this wonderful small
            town.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Bonnie Johnson</h4>
          <p>As a senior citizen on a fixed income who uses medical marijuana, the additional
            costs for me to secure a medical marijuana card simply don’t make sense. If I have
            safe, regulated and local access to marijuana in Sherwood at a licensed adult-use
            marijuana retailer, I am able to maintain access to my needed medicine at a very
            reasonable cost – and still contribute to my community’s public safety funds!<br><br>
            Please – VOTE YES on Measure 34-299 and support the local senior citizens who
            depend on medical marijuana and safe, convenient access!</p>

        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Evan Consani, Rural Sherwood Resident</h4>
          <p>I’m tired of giving my money to a dispensary in another city when the tax revenue
            could come to Sherwood. This is a no brainer! I will be voting YES!<br><br>
            Please VOTE YES on Measure 34-299!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Sheri Ralston</h4>
          <p>The City of Sherwood needs additional funds for public safety. This measure
            is designed to help fund that gap. The City voters resoundingly approved a
            local tax on marijuana sales in 2016 but failed to overturn the ban on
            recreational sales. As a result, since 2016 no marijuana tax from either the
            state or city has been collected, resulting in the loss of hundreds of
            thousands of dollars in local tax revenue.<br><br>
            Now is the time to change this. Measure 34-299 has been written in such a
            way that a recreational dispensary can only be located in an industrial zoned
            area, far away from schools, parks and residential homes. Marijuana tax
            revenue from the taxes on sales can be used for a variety of public safety
            needs and these funds will come every year that a dispensary is operating in
            the city.<br><br>
            That’s why it makes sense to Vote YES on Measure 34-299.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-5">
          <h5 class="text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-3">Statement of Support, Maren Harris, Sherwood Resident and Chief Petitioner</h4>
          <p>I am chief petitioner behind the effort to once again present Sherwood residents
            with a choice to allow strictly regulated recreational marijuana businesses in our
            town. Surrounded by jurisdictions that permit and encourage development of
            recreational marijuana, it’s not as if there is no marijuana being used (or grown) by
            Sherwood residents. The primary effect of the ban in Sherwood has been expanded
            black market sales of untested, unregulated marijuana.<br><br>
            My question for any voter considering this measure is simple: why do we refuse to
            accept the benefits of Oregon’s recreational marijuana (and bypass hundreds of
            thousands in state taxes) and actively pursue policies that negatively impact our
            community?<br><br>
            This ban has meant less revenue for our city and even less control for our city
            leaders. That doesn’t make sense. My children use city services, attend our local
            schools, play in our city parks, and most importantly, depend on local law
            enforcement for their safety (and my peace of mind!). Yet the refusal to have a sane
            and realistic policy toward recreational marijuana business in Sherwood means that
            our town continues to lose out on huge cash infusions that would have resulted
            directly from recreational marijuana sales – and at a rate six times higher than
            originally estimated!<br><br>
            Measure 34-299 is designed to incorporate and address the various practical
            concerns voiced by the community: Can we fund more public safety efforts in
            Sherwood? Can marijuana businesses be restricted to industrial zones? Can
            Sherwood qualify for its share of the state tax revenue, along with a local tax? Can
            we squeeze out black market sales and keep products in the hands of responsible
            adults over 21 years? Can Sherwood enforce site design requirements to ensure
            there are no offensive or unattractive businesses entering our community?<br><br>
            The answer to all these questions is YES! And that’s exactly why you should vote YES
            on Measure 34-299!</p>
